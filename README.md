```bash
$ npm install node-of-cards
```

## Quick Start

Using **node-of-cards** is simple:

```javascript
var cards = require('node-of-cards');
```

### Create a new deck

```javascript
cards.shuffle(options, function (err, data) {
    // play around with data
  });
```

Response **data** is of type

```javascript
{
  deck_id: 'slq5ewnxdrl1' // useful in case you want to keep track of multiple decks,
  success: true,
  shuffled: true,
  remaining: 52 // number of cards remaining in the deck
}
```

The ```options``` object is **optional** and contains the following parameters:

  - **number_of_decks**: number -- specify how many decks you want to play with (number of cards in one deck: **52**). Default is 0.
  - **cards**: array -- an array of strings used to only include some cards in the deck. These are of format ```card+suit``` (AS = Ace of Spaces, 8H = 8 of Hearts, 0C = 10 of Clubs). Defaults is [].

Example:

```javascript
{
  number_of_decks: 4,
  cards: ['AS', 'KS', 'QS', 'JS', '0S', '9S', '8S', 'AD', 'KD', 'QD', 'JD', '0D', '9D', '8D']
};
```

});
```

Cards in an unshuffled deck are in the following order: A-spades, 2-spades, 3-spades... followed by diamonds, clubs, then hearts.

### Add Cards to a Pile

```javascript
cards.addToPile(name, cards, function (err, data) {
  // play around with data
});
```
where ```name``` is the name of the pile you wish to create and ```cards``` is an array of cards to be added.
**!!!** Cards added to a pile need to be first drawn from the deck.

    }
  },
  remaining: 48

```

### Draw cards from a Pile

cards.drawFromPile(name, cards, function (err, data) {
  // play around with data
});
```

where ```name``` is the name of the pile you wish to create and ```cards``` is an array of cards to be drawn. The ```cards``` parameter is optional. If omitted, the top card of the pile will be drawn.

Example 1:

```javascript
cards.drawFromPile('player_one', function (err, data) {
  // play around with top card of the pile
});
```
